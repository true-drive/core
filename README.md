# True Drive Core

## Description
True Drive is a storage solution that allows you to encrypt any file to a noise video and upload it to YouTube. This way, you can store your files securely and access them from anywhere with an internet connection. You can also download and decrypt the noise videos back to your original files whenever you need them.

This repository houses the core functionality of True Drive which lies in the process of encrypting/decrypting files into a series of random pixels and sound waves.
